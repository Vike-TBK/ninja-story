Son of [[Kazan]], Reikazan is the emperor of the [[East Kingdom]], and husband to [[Masarume]]. he is referred as "His Majesty," "His Eminence." or "Emperor Reikazan."
When he became emperor, he saw the kingdom in disarray and chaos, and commanded [[The Old]] Clan to use the magic gemstones for his new forces, and to bring peace. this command split [[The Old]] apart into three parts, with one part, ([[The Secret]]) following him in his command. A few years after this command, his brother, [[Civil]], disavowed Reikazan's actions, calling them "destructive to our father's beliefs." This caused a civil war to break out, lasting 2 years before [[Civil]] and his sons were assassinated by [[Torin]] and [[Jin]], under the orders of Reikazan.
At some point he had an affair with another woman, [[Masarume]], resulting in the birth of [[Sayura]]. Reikazan brought the infant child to his wife [[Masarume]], saying he found her on the steps of the palace. He convinced her to adopt the child and raise her, until [[Masarume]] found out. She started abusing [[Sayura]] and said if he ever interfered with her, she would tell the kingdom about this affair.
