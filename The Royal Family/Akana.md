Akana is the second child of the royal family, Born [[Reikazan]] and [[Masarume]]. 
When she was a child, she wanted to rule the kingdom, but can't. 
She didn't like any of her sisters, and when she found out about [[Sayura]]'s backstory, it was the spark the lit the flame. 
She wants power and control in everything she touches, and has no Boundaries in what she wants.

**age:** 22-23

**Personality:** Sadistic, controlling, deeply narcissistic. 
Takes pleasure in abusing [[Sayura]] (in every way.) Boundary-less. her only limit is getting caught, and even then sheâ€™s slippery. Only [[Tazume]] can stop her, and even that is a delicate act.

Goal: She wants power and control in everything she touches, and has no Boundaries in what she wants.
